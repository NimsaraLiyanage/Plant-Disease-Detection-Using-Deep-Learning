# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
Developed a plant disease detection system using deep learning for early disease identification. Compared VGG16 and ResNet50 models on a dataset of healthy and diseased leaf images. ResNet50 achieved 90.24% test accuracy, outperforming VGG16. Improved crop management through advanced image classification.


Title:
Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning 

Description:
As part of an advanced deep learning course for electrical and computer engineers, I collaborated with a talented team to develop a sophisticated plant disease detection system. Our project, titled "Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning," aimed to assist in early disease identification and improve crop management by leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models.

We utilized a dataset comprising RGB photos of healthy and diseased leaves, specifically focusing on diseases like Apple Scab, Black Rot, and Cedar Apple Rust. The project involved:

Model Selection: We compared two pre-trained deep learning models, VGG16 and ResNet50, to determine the most effective model for our classification task.
Dataset Preparation: Organized data into training, validation, and test sets with appropriate preprocessing to ensure consistent input size and normalization.
Model Training and Evaluation: Implemented and trained both models over 20 epochs, analyzing training and validation accuracy. Post-training, we evaluated model performance on a separate test dataset.
Results: ResNet50 demonstrated superior performance with a test accuracy of 90.24%, indicating better generalization and robustness compared to VGG16, which had a test accuracy of 82.93%.
This project highlighted the practical applications of deep learning in agriculture, showcasing the potential to significantly enhance plant disease management and crop health monitoring. The ResNet50 model's balanced performance and generalization capabilities make it a reliable choice for real-world deployment in plant diseaseÂ detection.
