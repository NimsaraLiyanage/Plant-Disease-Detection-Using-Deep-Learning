# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
Developed a plant disease detection system using deep learning for early disease identification. Compared VGG16 and ResNet50 models on a dataset of healthy and diseased leaf images. ResNet50 achieved 90.24% test accuracy, outperforming VGG16. Improved crop management through advanced image classification.
